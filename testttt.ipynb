    "<span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">Predicting Cancellation of Domestic Flights in the USA. Flight cancellation is a rare event but a big concern for many people/organization. Because if you have a flight, most probably all other your plans will be based on your arrival to the destination. Assume you have a holiday plan in LA, you booked your hotel, you rented your car, you made a reservation for an activity etc. But when you arrive the EWX airport you released that your flight is cancelled. Then you have to alter all your plans due to this unexpexted rare event . It is needless to say you would have taken necessary precautions if you had known your flightâ€™s cancellation in advance. Definitely there are many factors which may result in those cancellations such as origin and destination airport location, airline company, time of flight etc. In this study we will propose a model to predict flight cancellations for US domestic flights at 20 most used airports in the USA.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">a. Travellers : Flight cancellations have a huge impact on whoever will have a flight trip, so travellers definitely can care cancellations.\n",

    "   \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">b. Travel Planners : Some organization companies like tourism agency make plan for their organizations. For instance they sell cultural/historical or holiday travel package. If their flight cancelled then they may have encounter big problems. In this context, they also care about flight cancellation prediction.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">c. Online Booking Companies : Booking.com, Kayak.com, Skyscanner.com are top online flight ticket selling companies. Cancelled flights will defintely affect their business negatively. If they known in advace/ predict cancellations they can inform their customers to take precaution against the problem which may stem from flight cancellation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">d. Airline Companies : Airline companies may suffer from cancellation very much. If they have relatively higher cancellation rates they may have a customer churn problem. In order to avoid this problem they aslo care it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">e. Hotels : Even hotels, espacially located nearby airports (destination) may be affected by cancelled flights. They may show interest on predicting cancelled flighs. </p>\n",

    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span style=\"color: black; font-family: Babas; font-size: 1.2em;\">All those shareholders may be affected because of flight cancellations. To minimize the negative effect of cancellation by predicting those cancellations we will build some ML algortihms.\n",

This data contains information about flights and their on-time performance, including date of flight, carrier company, origin and destination airports, flight duration, flight distance, delay, cancellation, diversion etc.\n",
